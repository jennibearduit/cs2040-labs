# CS2040 Labs

This respository contains my lab assignment solutions for CS2040 Data Structures and Algorithms (Summer 2020, Special Term). 

## About CS2040

CS2040 introduces students to the design and implementation of fundamental data structures and algorithms. 
Topics include basic data structures (linked lists, stacks, queues, hash tables, binary heaps, trees, and graphs), 
searching and sorting algorithms, and basic analysis of algorithms.
